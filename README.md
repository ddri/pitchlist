# Q&A 

Some questions you should be asking:

- How much time will it take me to make my perfect deck? 
- How will I know when it's good enough?
- How "optimistic" should it be?
- How much detail should I put into the deck (graphics versus facts)?
- How much effort should I put into the design quality?
- How often will I need to update the deck?
- Should I just email the deck to people?
